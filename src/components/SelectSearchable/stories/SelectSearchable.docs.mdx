# SelectSearchable

A composable, searchable, and accessible select component that supports single and multiple
selection, custom triggers, and large option sets.

<Canvas of={RootStories.Playground} />

## SelectSearchable.Root

**SelectSearchable.Root** is the top-level component that manages state, focus, and accessibility for the select.
It wraps a hidden native `<select>` element that can be used for traditional form submissions and other native functionality.

<Controls of={RootStories.Playground} />

## SelectSearchable.Trigger

**SelectSearchable.Trigger** renders the interactive control that opens and closes the dropdown.

<details>
  It wraps a native `<button>` element and forwards all standard `<button>` attributes **except** those managed by the Root context.

  **Controlled props (cannot be overridden):**

  - `id`
  - `type`
  - `disabled`
  - `role`
  - `aria-...`

  The Trigger’s `id` is stable and derived from the Root `id`, using the suffix `--control`.

  **Children**

  `children` may be either:
  - A `ReactNode`, or
  - A render function receiving: `value`, `values`, `isOpen`, `multiple`.

  **Styling**

  Exposes `data-part='trigger'` and `data-state='open | closed'` for easy custom styling.
